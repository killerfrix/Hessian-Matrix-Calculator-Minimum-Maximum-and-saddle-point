# Hessian-Matrix-Calculator-Minimum-Maximum-and-saddle-point
In this Code we can calculate the Hessian Matrix of an input x and y to check its critical points like Minimum, Maximum and saddle point

Also we can appreciate the critical point in a 3d graphic generated way as a point in the function drawed
