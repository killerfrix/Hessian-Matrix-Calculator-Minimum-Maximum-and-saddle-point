# Hessian-Matrix-Calculator-Minimum-Maximum-and-saddle-point
In this Code we can calculate the Hessian Matrix of an input x and y to check its critical points like Minimum, Maximum and saddle point

Also we can appreciate the critical point in a 3d graphic generated way as a point in the function drawed

In order to run everything you will need to install some stuff in your python console

pip install numpy matplotlib sympy

Once they are installed you can run the program and input a function in python language to check its graphic and critical point generated by the Hessian Matrix
